Project Mission:
   We want to keep our first iteration very simple!
   We are going to do this somehwat like AGILE: get a Minimum Viable Project, refactor and modify as we go

   What does the MVP look like here?
        A real bare bones idea is to envision a 'train car' like game where a player should only move in one direction
        but is technically allowed to move both directions. No items, just moving through the rooms.

   Next Step:
