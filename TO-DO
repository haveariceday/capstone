Project Mission:
   We want to keep our first iteration very simple!
   We are going to do this somehwat like AGILE: get a Minimum Viable Project, refactor and modify as we go

   What does the MVP look like here?
        A real bare bones idea is to envision a 'train car' like game where a player should only move in one direction
        but is technically allowed to move both directions. No items, just moving through the rooms.

11/27 next step:


hide objects room field if proper feature not lookat yet

add game field to feature IF it has a mini game attached.

add requiredItems field as a list maybe, to game dictionary
